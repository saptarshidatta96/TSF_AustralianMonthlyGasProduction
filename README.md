# TSF_AustralianMonthlyGasProduction

In this problem we would be exploring the Australia Monthly Gas Production dataset available in the library “forecast” of R.

-	Read the data as a time series object in R. Plot the data 
- What do you observe? Which components of the time series are present in this dataset?
-	What is the periodicity of dataset? 
-	Is the time series Stationary? Inspect visually as well as conduct an ADF test? Write down the null and alternate hypothesis for the stationarity test? De-seasonalise the series if seasonality is present? 
-	Develop an ARIMA Model to forecast for next 12 periods. Use both manual and auto.arima (Show & explain all the steps) 
-	Report the accuracy of the model 


Let’s get started.

Set the working directory and load the data file.
